# NumberOfEvaluations
Perhaps you're asked to do peer evaluations. You can't evaluate everyone. But, you don't want to play favorites, either. 
Hopefully, you have numbers assigned to each evaluatee! 
This script asks you how many possible evaluations there are.
Then, it asks how many you can do. After all, you're only human. 
It spits out the number/s of the persons you're now assigned to evaluate.
Then, it gives that same list in order.
